# Data analysis of hotel reservations


## Description

For each of the following business questions, perform a data analysis with SQL and build a report with Looker Studio.

1) What are the popular choices of booking rates for different segments of customers?

2) What are the typical guests who do online check-in? Is it different when you compare reservations created across different weekdays?

3) Look at the average night revenue per single occupied capacity. What guest segment is the most profitable per occupied space unit?

4) Estimate what would be the impact on total room revenue if the overall usage of online checkin doubled.

5) Analyse the quality of the input data.
